## âœ… Problem Statement:  

There are **n** stones on the table in a row. Each stone can be red (`R`), green (`G`), or blue (`B`).  

You must find the **minimum number of stones to remove** so that no two neighboring stones have the same color. Stones are considered neighbors if there are no other stones between them.  

---

## ðŸ§  Logic Explained:  

1. Read `n` (number of stones) and `s` (string of stone colors).  
2. Initialize a counter `removals = 0`.  
3. Loop through the string from the first stone to the second-last stone:  
   - If the current stone `s[i]` is the same as the next stone `s[i+1]`, increment `removals` by 1.  
4. Print `removals` as the result.

## ðŸ•’ Time and Space Complexity:  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) â€” we check each stone once.  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) â€” only a counter variable is used.
