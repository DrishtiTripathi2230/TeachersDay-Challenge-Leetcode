## âœ… Problem Statement:

Sometimes some words like "localization" or "internationalization" are too long to write in full.

To abbreviate such words, we use the following rule:

.Replace the middle letters with the count of letters in between.

.So, localization â†’ l10n, internationalization â†’ i18n.

You are given n words. For each word, if itâ€™s length is more than 10, abbreviate it. Otherwise, print it as it is.

---
## ðŸ§  Logic Explained:

1.Read the number of words n.

2.For each word:

.If the word length is â‰¤ 10, print it directly.

.Otherwise:

  .Print the first character.

  .Print the number of characters between first and last (length - 2).

  .Print the last character.

ðŸ•’ Time and Space Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(n) â€” one pass per word.

Space Complexity: O(1) â€” no extra space used besides input strings.
