## âœ… Problem Statement:

Each member of a programming team has an opinion on whether a problem is solvable. If at least two out of three teammates are confident about a solution, the team decides to implement it.

You are given n problems, and for each, the opinion of three teammates (0 or 1). Your task is to determine how many problems the team will implement.


---
## ðŸ§  Logic Explained:

1.Read the number of problems n.

2.For each problem:

.Input three integers (a, b, c) representing teammates' opinions.

.If the sum of these three values is â‰¥ 2, increment the count.

3.Print the total count.

ðŸ•’ Time and Space Complexity:

Time Complexity:O(n) â€“ one pass through all n problems

Space Complexity: O(1) â€“ only a few variables used
