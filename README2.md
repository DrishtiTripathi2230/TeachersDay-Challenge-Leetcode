## âœ… Problem Statement:

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.

answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.

answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.

answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

## ðŸ§  Logic Explained:

1.Initialize an empty string vector result.

2.Loop from 1 to n:

 .If the current number is divisible by both 3 and 5, add "FizzBuzz" to the result.

 .Else if divisible by 3 only, add "Fizz".

 .Else if divisible by 5 only, add "Buzz".

 .Else, convert the number to string using to_string(i) and add it.

3.Return the final result vector.

ðŸ•’ Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n) â€” we iterate from 1 to n once.

Space Complexity: O(n) â€” to store the result in a string array/vector.
