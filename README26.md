## âœ… Problem Statement:  

You are given a string of characters 0 and 1, representing players of two football teams standing in a line.  

A situation is considered *dangerous* if there are *at least 7 consecutive players* from the same team.  

- Print *"YES"* if the situation is dangerous.  
- Otherwise, print *"NO"*.  

---

## ðŸ§  Logic Explained:  

1. Read the input string.  
2. Initialize a counter to 1 for consecutive characters.  
3. Loop through the string:  
   - If the current character equals the previous one â†’ increment the counter.  
   - If the counter reaches *7* â†’ print "YES" and exit.  
   - Otherwise, reset the counter to 1 when characters differ.  
4. If the loop ends without finding 7 in a row â†’ print "NO".

## ðŸ•’ Time and Space Complexity:  

- *Time Complexity:* O(n) â€“ single traversal of the string.  
- *Space Complexity:* O(1) â€“ only one counter variable used.
