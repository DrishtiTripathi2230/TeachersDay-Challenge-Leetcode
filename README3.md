## âœ… Problem Statement:

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

---
## ðŸ§  Logic Explained:

1.Initialize an empty string cleaned.

2.Loop through each character in the input string s:

.If it's alphanumeric, convert it to lowercase and add to cleaned.

3.Once cleaned is ready, check if itâ€™s a palindrome:

.Compare characters from the beginning and end, moving inward.

.If any pair doesnâ€™t match â†’ return false.

4.If all pairs match â†’ return true.

ðŸ•’ Time and Space Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(n)

We go through the string twice â€” once to clean it, once to check palindrome.

Space Complexity: O(n)

Due to the cleaned string we create.
