## âœ… Problem Statement:

Given an array `nums` of integers, return how many of them contain **an even number of digits**.

---
## ðŸ§  Logic Explained:

- Iterate through the given array of integers.
- For each number:
  - Use a `while(num > 0)` loop to count how many digits it has.
  - In each iteration, divide the number by 10 and increment a counter.
- After counting the digits, check if the count is even using `digitCount % 2 == 0`.
- If true, increment a `result` counter.
- Finally, return the value of `result`.
