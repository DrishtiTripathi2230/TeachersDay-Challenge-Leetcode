### Problem Statement  
Vasya dislikes when people mix uppercase and lowercase letters in a single word.  
He wants to change the given word so that either:  
- All letters are lowercase, or  
- All letters are uppercase,  

with the minimum number of changes.  

If the number of uppercase letters is greater, the entire word is converted to uppercase.
